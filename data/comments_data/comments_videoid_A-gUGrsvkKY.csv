A-gUGrsvkKY,@initiatorhater0688,2024-08-16T23:29:41Z,2024-08-16T23:29:41Z,0,"it reminds me, while a woman has never said this to me when asking her out, i know it happens at times when a woman is asked out by a guy after having a conversation or interaction with her, when she is not sure what the guy is doing, she will say to him &quot;are you asking me out?&quot;, i know of how i will respond if a woman says that to me, i will say to her:<br><br>&quot;Duh!!!!!, of course i&#39;m asking you out, i&#39;m a guy, its what we do!!&quot;, i just feel like sarcastically and ventingly responding to a woman like that, just expressing my anger and rage towards women due to how they have always played a passive role in human mating, i know i&#39;m not the only guy in the world that sometimes hates women because of how passive they are in the courtship phase or attraction phase, forming a relationship, etc., how it seems men have always had to do all or most of the work when it comes to starting a relationship, and it gets me more mad when people and society say that guys, men, are not supposed to view it as work, that men are supposed to view it as a joy and gift on what the man is expected to do when making a relationship happen or start, taking the lead in everything in the beginning, etc.<br><br>Well people have a right to their mindset.<br><br>Yes, it truly does feel unfair being a man at times. I get more pissed off whenever people and society say &quot;we don&#39;t have to deal with pregnancy or childbirth&quot;, that only pisses me off even further."

You could have been spent a bit more of time to highlight the differences: the girl not talking/not comfortable, not turning her body towards you (body language), etc. Btw the random chicken conversation was amazing üòÇ‚ù§"
A-gUGrsvkKY,@Leto1988,2024-08-15T13:11:25Z,2024-08-15T13:11:25Z,1,"I don&#39;t mean to critique, but you seem to always stand a bit too close to these girls, may seem a bit intrusive. Also you&#39;re maybe this very high energy person but I think you talk too fast not leaving much room to breathe in these conversations. Apart from that all great, you&#39;re very confident in what you do."

A-gUGrsvkKY,@damirderek8827,2024-08-15T09:41:00Z,2024-08-15T09:44:42Z,0,This summer I went on approach rampage on beaches and first few approaches are always wierd but after some time when you get in that momentum you can approach every girl you see with ease even in groups. In daygame most fun for me is to approach girls in caffee bar and after some time sit with them like you are on date.

It makes it seem less needy, which is good. She will still have the same flattery but she is not put on a pedistal."
A-gUGrsvkKY,@AyanokoG,2024-08-14T21:00:53Z,2024-08-14T21:00:53Z,5,I like the tip with the semi-direct opener having less pressure.
