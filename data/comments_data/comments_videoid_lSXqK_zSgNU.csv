lSXqK_zSgNU,@assezzen194,2024-08-01T21:40:41Z,2024-08-01T21:41:29Z,0,"When flirting, is your goal to have her flirt back ? Apart from being &quot;lucky&quot; and finding a girl who is spontaneously awake and ready to flirt back, how can this be brought or provoked ? Can it be flirty if the guy is the only one talking and she just smiles and laughs and nods... Is it necessary or optional that she flirts back ?"
lSXqK_zSgNU,@trainingwood,2024-07-31T17:46:38Z,2024-07-31T17:46:38Z,0,You had some great insights and advice but it seems to me that you are talking a lil bit too fast and  I mean it is understandable that silence is big no no when you do not  know somebody but I noticed If I am  not going slowly then I cannot gauge the interaction and adjust  accordingly.

lSXqK_zSgNU,@jasond626,2024-07-27T00:25:55Z,2024-07-27T00:25:55Z,1,This really reminds me of street attraction (that BBC did a documentary and finished street attraction). You talk just like ed does and the edge of the other guy that used to be in street attraction. The room you are videoing in I think was the same room as street attraction. Your game style is very much cocky (street attraction style) and I think a lot of people would struggle with your style tbh.. good ideas in video. Hard for people to pull off without you confidence and experience etc

Damn I just realized with your infield while you&#39;re having fun that I was wayyy too on purpose on my last 50 approaches or so. Shit ! Formal and goal driven, and thus nervous.

For example yoi talkr about non traditional girls, show us how those conversatioms go down. The reason alot of people struggle is they see a video like this and assume everything will go perfectly and get disheartened when it doesnt.  Great Video otherwise"

One thing that inspires me about all your videos and I know this might sound a weird thing to say is that you make me believe that guys in glasses can still get girls attracted to them, as a glasses wearer myself I‚Äôve always felt like girls would not be attracted to me, always thinking that‚Äôs it‚Äôs ‚Äúover for me‚Äù especially as I‚Äôve gotten older because I thought girls would always not be attracted to how I look with my glasses on and instead prefer a Chad like ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù look but I‚Äôm happy to see in your videos that girls don‚Äôt really seem to care (not that you don‚Äôt look good anyway because you do), it‚Äôs more my insecurity that I need to get over, but it‚Äôs tough sometimes."
