pfmZ69WGysA,@rambo7135,2024-07-14T21:00:11Z,2024-07-14T21:00:11Z,1,The problem with the front stop is it seems a little too agressive because you&#39;re blocking a girl&#39;s path. Its not always the best way and especially not in a small town or city. Also the running makes you look desperate although guys might argue you&#39;re going after what you want but this way is just not natural.<br><br>Another issue is when a guy blocks a girl&#39;s path like this it can cause anxiety in the girl.<br><br>Also the streets/outside are not the only places to meet women. You also dont always need to go Direct. In certain situations Direct just won&#39;t be appropriate. Guys really need to learn multiple ways of approaching and not just becoming one trick ponies!

pfmZ69WGysA,@TheSonicseduction,2024-07-10T15:06:56Z,2024-07-10T15:06:56Z,1,"The main purpose of the frontal stop (classic Yad Stop) is because it is the most efficient way to train your conviction, show intention, and open strongly. The problem with the side stop (for beginners and beginner-intermediates) is that it is a false illusion of approach. The girl says no and thank you, and you feel falsely validated because at least you tried (but there was no conviction from the start)...<br><br>Side stops are also efficient, for example, if you just need to ask for information. It&#39;s not necessary to stop a girl just to ask where the subway is. And if a girl likes you (talking about numbers game), she won&#39;t reject you just because you didn&#39;t stop her correctly.<br><br>It&#39;s all a matter of conviction."
pfmZ69WGysA,@benglue5396,2024-07-05T14:25:22Z,2024-07-05T14:25:22Z,2,I have never done a yad stop. I feel so much more natural if I only approach  a girl I&#39;ve made eye contact with. Then the side stop feels most authentic to me.
